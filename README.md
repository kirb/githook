# githook
**Twitter and Slack notification bot for GitHub events.**

The bot I use for [@kirbgit](https://twitter.com/kirbgit) as well as Slack integrations. Based on top of [a fork of gith](https://github.com/amaline/gith) (unfortunately both this fork and the parent repo seem to be unmaintained).

Currently only handles push and tag events.
